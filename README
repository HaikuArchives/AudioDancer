About AudioDancer
=================

AudioDancer is a silly little program I wrote to experiment with 
BAudioSubscribers. It attempts to display audio information (presumably
from the CD player) in interesting ways.

AudioDancer is freeware.


*** BUG! ***
============

AudioDancer won't quit. It appears to quit, but it never disappears from the
app menu. If you can figure out why please let me know.


Using AudioDancer
=================

AudioDancer currently provides four viewing methods

1) Waves
	- displays each data buffer as a wave
2) Lines
	- displays each data buffer as a blob of lines
3) Static
	- displays a bitmap containing the bits from the data buffer
4) Dancers
	- dancing balls whose behavior is controlled by data buffers
	
It's important to note that the Lines and Dancers display modes
were stumbled upon by trial and error. I was looking for interesting
images, and the current functions were the ones I decided upon. I really
was unsure of what meant what in the data buffer so I just experimented.


Recommended Listening
=====================

The coolest thing I've seen so far was in Dancer mode listening to
Jethro Tull's Aqualung. Particularly "Wond'ring Around" (Track 5) is
interesting. Be sure to reset the dancers (Alt-D) before starting the
track. Also, keep your load to a minimum when playing with AudioDancer
because it's much less interesting when it drops buffers.


Distribution
============

Feel free to distribute AudioDancer in any way that you can. I only ask that
this README file is always included with the executable, and that you're
not bundling AudioDancer with something else as a purchase incentive.

If you make any changes to the source code, please DO NOT distribute it
without first contacting me.
